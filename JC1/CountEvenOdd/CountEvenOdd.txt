A procedure Count() will:
1. input a value (all values will be positive integers) 
2. count the number of odd values and count the number of even values
3. repeat from step 1 until the value input is 99 
4. output the two count values, with a suitable message. 
The value 99 must not be counted. 
Write an algorithm as pseudocode for the procedure Count().


PROCEDURE Count()
    Even = 0
    Odd = 0
    OUTPUT "Enter a value"
    INPUT Num
    WHILE Num <> 99
        THEN
            IF MOD(Num,2) = 0
                THEN
                    Even = Even + 1
                ELSE
                    Odd =  Odd + 1
            ENDIF
    ENDWHILE
ENDPROCEDURE
