Write as a pseudocode algorithm to calculate the factorial
of a number using function called fact() which takes as input 
a number and returns the factorial of that number

FUNCTION fact(Num) RETURNS INTEGER
    Factorial <- 1
    FOR Count <- 1 TO Num
        Factorial <- Factorial * Count
    NEXT Count
    RETURN Factorial

OUTPUT "Enter a number: "
INPUT Num
TempFactorial <- fact(Num)
OUTPUT "The factorial is" , TempFactorial
